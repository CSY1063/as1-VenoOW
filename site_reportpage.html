        <h1>Site report:</h1>
        <p>I had a great learning experience whilst developing this profollio website, there were many many many downs but when the ups came they were so great. I think one of the things that stand out and I like most about my website is the navigation, I spent a lot of time and research to try to get it to look as good as possible this lead me to many many different sources. often in the form of youtube videos. I watched a lot of these youtube videos. I took, mixed, and matched different ideas from these videos that I liked and changed them to fit the style that I wanted such as having the navigation be highlited whenever the cursor is on it. ironically as much as I had on the desktop navigation. The mobile navigation has been my biggest pain to get to work. ive watched multiple videos on how to make a working hamburger menu however most of them end up using Javascript or they just use methods i'm unfamiliar with as of now I can only get it to appear when tapping the hamburger but not to disappear. I also have problems making it appear and even work on the other pages so making my site fully mobile optimised is my biggest concern. aside from that my background across all pages is something else im proud of. this is because at first I found it really difficult to grasp how the animation worked, however after researching a bit and refreshing myself on the lecture slides I eventually was able to do it</p>
