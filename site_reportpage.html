        <h1>Site report:</h1>
        <p>I had a great learning experience whilst developing this profollio website, there were many many many downs but when the ups came they were so great. I think one of the things that stand out and I like most about my website is the navigation, I spent a lot of time and research to try to get it to look as good as possible this lead me to many many different sources. often in the form of youtube videos. I watched a lot of these youtube videos. I took, mixed, and matched different ideas from these videos that I liked and changed them to fit the style that I wanted such as having the navigation be highlited whenever the cursor is on it. ironically as much as I had on the desktop navigation. The mobile navigation had been my biggest pain to get to work. I'd watched multiple videos on how to make a working hamburger menu using only css however most of them end up using Javascript or they just used methods I was unfamiliar with (still am).I also had problems making the hamburger just to appear on the other pages let alone have it functioning. So making my site fully mobile optimised was my biggest concern during development. To get my mobile optimisation all up-and-running I ended up using icons from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">fontawesome.com</a>. This was so much easier to work with than using one I built using css. Aside from that, my background across all pages is something else im proud of. originally i had planned on using a cyber/motherboard image as the background however I hadn't used animation in my website yet so I decided to make the background animated. At first I found it really difficult to grasp how the animating worked, however after researching a bit and refreshing myself on the lecture slides I eventually was able to grasp it and do what I think is a pretty cool background. </p>
